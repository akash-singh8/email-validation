# Email Validation System

Developing an email validation system using NodeJS

## Purpose

Recently, I was building a support portal where I needed to verify user's email. So, I thought, let's build our own email validator instead of using Firebase or other services.

## Email Validation Methods

There are two commonly used ways to validate emails:

### 1. OTP (One-Time Password) Verification

This method involves sending a one-time password to the user's email address. The user must enter the OTP to verify their email. This ensures that the user has access to the provided email inbox and confirms its validity.

### 2. Link Verification

Link verification works by sending a verification link to the user's email address. When the user clicks the link, their email is validated.
